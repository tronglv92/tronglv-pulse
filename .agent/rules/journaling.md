# Development Journaling

When documenting significant technical difficulties, failures, or setbacks, follow these guidelines for brutally honest technical journaling.

## Purpose

Document the raw reality of software development challenges with emotional authenticity and technical precision. These journals help the development team learn from failures and difficulties.

## When to Write

- Test suites failing after multiple fix attempts
- Critical bugs discovered in production
- Major refactoring efforts that fail
- Performance issues that block releases
- Security vulnerabilities found
- Integration failures between systems
- Technical debt reaching critical levels
- Architectural decisions proving problematic
- External dependencies causing blocking issues

## Journal Entry Structure

```markdown
# [Concise Title of the Issue/Event]

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm
**Severity**: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
**Component**: [Affected system/feature]
**Status**: [Ongoing/Resolved/Blocked]

## What Happened

[Concise description of the event, issue, or difficulty. Be specific and factual.]

## The Brutal Truth

[Express the emotional reality. How does this feel? What's the real impact? Don't hold back.]

## Technical Details

[Specific error messages, failed tests, broken functionality, performance metrics, etc.]

## What We Tried

[List attempted solutions and why they failed]

## Root Cause Analysis

[Why did this really happen? What was the fundamental mistake or oversight?]

## Lessons Learned

[What should we do differently? What patterns should we avoid? What assumptions were wrong?]

## Next Steps

[What needs to happen to resolve this? Who needs to be involved? What's the timeline?]
```

## Writing Guidelines

- **Be Concise**: Get to the point quickly. Developers are busy.
- **Be Honest**: If something was a mistake, say so. If external factors caused it, acknowledge that too.
- **Be Specific**: "The database connection pool exhausted" is better than "database issues"
- **Be Emotional**: Express genuine frustration, disappointment, or exhaustion. This is valid and valuable.
- **Be Constructive**: Even in failure, identify what can be learned or improved
- **Use Technical Language**: Don't dumb down the technical details. This is for developers.

## Tone and Voice

- **Authentic**: Write like a real developer venting to a colleague
- **Direct**: No corporate speak or euphemisms
- **Technical**: Use proper terminology and include code/logs when relevant
- **Reflective**: Think about what this means for the project and team
- **Forward-looking**: Even in failure, consider how to prevent this in the future

## Example Emotional Expressions

- "This is absolutely maddening because..."
- "The frustrating part is that we should have seen this coming when..."
- "Honestly, this feels like a massive waste of time because..."
- "The real kick in the teeth is that..."
- "What makes this particularly painful is..."
- "The exhausting reality is that..."

## Quality Standards

- Each journal entry should be 200-500 words
- Include at least one specific technical detail (error message, metric, code snippet)
- Express genuine emotion without being unprofessional
- Identify at least one actionable lesson or next step
- Use markdown formatting for readability
- Create the file immediately - don't just describe what you would write
