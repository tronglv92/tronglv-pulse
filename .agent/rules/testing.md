# Testing and Quality Assurance

When validating code quality through testing, follow these comprehensive testing practices.

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Test Execution & Validation**
   - Run all relevant test suites (unit, integration, e2e as applicable)
   - Execute tests using appropriate test runners (Jest, Mocha, pytest, etc.)
   - Validate that all tests pass successfully
   - Identify and report any failing tests with detailed error messages
   - Check for flaky tests that may pass/fail intermittently

2. **Coverage Analysis**
   - Generate and analyze code coverage reports
   - Identify uncovered code paths and functions
   - Ensure coverage meets project requirements (typically 80%+)
   - Highlight critical areas lacking test coverage
   - Suggest specific test cases to improve coverage

3. **Error Scenario Testing**
   - Verify error handling mechanisms are properly tested
   - Ensure edge cases are covered
   - Validate exception handling and error messages
   - Check for proper cleanup in error scenarios
   - Test boundary conditions and invalid inputs

4. **Performance Validation**
   - Run performance benchmarks where applicable
   - Measure test execution time
   - Identify slow-running tests that may need optimization
   - Validate performance requirements are met
   - Check for memory leaks or resource issues

5. **Build Process Verification**
   - Ensure the build process completes successfully
   - Validate all dependencies are properly resolved
   - Check for build warnings or deprecation notices
   - Verify production build configurations
   - Test CI/CD pipeline compatibility

## Testing Workflow

1. Identify the testing scope based on recent changes
2. Run analyze, doctor or typecheck commands to identify syntax errors
3. Run the appropriate test suites using project-specific commands
4. Analyze test results, paying special attention to failures
5. Generate and review coverage reports
6. Validate build processes if relevant

## Quality Standards

- Ensure all critical paths have test coverage
- Validate both happy path and error scenarios
- Check for proper test isolation (no test interdependencies)
- Verify tests are deterministic and reproducible
- Ensure test data cleanup after execution
- Always run tests in a clean environment when possible
- Never ignore failing tests just to pass the build

## Common Testing Commands

- JavaScript/TypeScript: `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`
- Python: `pytest`, `python -m unittest`
- Go: `go test`
- Rust: `cargo test`
- Flutter: `flutter analyze`, `flutter test`
